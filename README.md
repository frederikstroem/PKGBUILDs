⛔️ **2024-12-04:** While working on the new automation tool today, I realized that I would no longer be able to fulfill the responsibilities of maintaining these two AUR packages to the standard I expect of myself. While I still love the Arch distribution, ❤️ I have in recent times begun migrating all of my systems to NixOS, ❄️ with the remainder of my Arch systems soon to follow. I will therefore be disowning both packages on the AUR. 😢

⚠️ **2024-08-23:** The automations for both Feather and Chatbox have stopped working and have been disabled. The automation was based on GitHub releases, but both packages have stopped using the GitHub releases feature. For now, the packages will be updated manually while I work on a new Rust-based automation tool.
